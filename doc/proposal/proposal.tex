	\section{Summary} {

		This project aims to detect spheres within an image, based on the shading around its environment, and will have a heavy focus on performance and accuracy. The results of this project will be utilised by the Newcastle Robotics Laboratory and has the potential to impact their results at RoboCup, an international robotic soccer competition. This project is of significant interest to the robot soccer community as the results of this could yield a more efficient method of real-time ball detection, which is also beneficial to those who are interested in ball detection within a competitive sports environment such as basketball or tennis.
		
	}

	\section{Background} {

		Keeping track of a ball is a natural and fundamental aspect of playing soccer, that many human players would not consider to be a skill in itself. Ball tracking is important in robotic soccer, where fast and reliable ball tracking is a challenge that has attracted research in the robot soccer community.

		This project aims to develop methods for sphere detection in a RoboCup environment, placing an emphasis on performance due to the limited capabilities of the target platform. In particular, the performance is significantly effected by the number of pixel samples read from a given image and will be minimised. The project will focus on developing a novel, minimal, multi-stage scanning and ball-detection strategy that minimises the sampling effort while still correctly recognising all balls that are present in the image without false positives.

		An implementation of the developed approach will be created by extending the NUbotsâ€™ existing vision system, to minimise the effort required. The results will be compared to the ball detection method used in their current vision system and to other competing ball detection techniques, with a heavy focus on performance and accuracy. If a robust approach is found, it could be generalised to detect other shapes such as robots, lines and goals based on a set of features.

		The following techniques will be considered during research:

		\begin{itemize}
			\item Clustering algorithms
			\begin{itemize}
				\item K-means
				\item DBSCAN
				\item OPTICS
			\end{itemize}
			\item Generic model fitting and improvement algorithms
			\begin{itemize}
				\item Hough transform
				\item Least squares optimisation
			\end{itemize}
			\item Sample consensus techniques
			\begin{itemize}
				\item RANSAC
				\item M-SAC
			\end{itemize}
			\item Machine learning techniques
			\begin{itemize}
				\item SVM
				\item KNN
				\item CNN
			\end{itemize}
			\item Input preprocessing techniques
			\begin{itemize}
				\item Lookup tables
				\item Image derivatives
				\item Filtering and smoothing methods
				\item Scanning strategies
			\end{itemize}
		\end{itemize}

		It is also possible to utilise the information gathered from previous frames, or from the robot platform itself, including the expected position, velocity and kinematics horizon.
