	\section{Summary} {

        % This project aims to detect spheres within an image, based on the
        % shading around its environment, and will have a heavy focus on
        % performance and accuracy. The results of this project will be utilised
        % by the Newcastle Robotics Laboratory and has the potential to impact
        % their results at RoboCup, an international robotic soccer competition.
        % This project is of significant interest to the robot soccer community
        % as the results of this could yield a more efficient method of real-
        % time ball detection, which is also beneficial to those who are
        % interested in ball detection within a competitive sports environment
        % such as basketball or tennis.
		
	}

	\section{Background and aims} {

  %       This project aims to develop methods for sphere detection in a RoboCup
  %       environment, placing an emphasis on performance due to the limited
  %       capabilities of the target platform. In particular, the performance is
  %       significantly effected by the number of pixel samples read from a
  %       given image and will be minimised. The project will focus on
  %       developing a novel, minimal, multi-stage scanning and ball-detection
  %       strategy that minimises the sampling effort while still correctly
  %       recognising all balls that are present in the image without false
  %       positives.

  %       An implementation of the developed approach will be created by
  %       extending the NUbotsâ€™ existing vision system, to minimise the effort
  %       required. The results will be compared to the ball detection method
  %       used in their current vision system and to other competing ball
  %       detection techniques, with a heavy focus on performance and accuracy.
  %       If a robust approach is found, it could be generalised to detect other
  %       shapes such as robots, lines and goals based on a set of features.

  %       It is also possible to utilise the information gathered from previous
  %       frames, or from the robot platform itself, including the expected
  %       position, velocity and kinematics horizon.

        Keeping track of the ball is so natural and fundamental an aspect of
        playing soccer that many human players would hardly think it to be a
        skill in itself.
        However, while it may come naturally to humans, fast and reliable ball
        tracking has presented a challenge that has attracted much research in
        the robot soccer community.
        
        \todo { 
            Refer to the progression of ball detection techniques from colour based to
            shape based and intensity based.

            Describe our approach as a natural
            next step.

            Add references here.
        }

        Early attempts at ball detection at Robocup simply used histogramming
        techniques targeted at a specific range of colour intensities to find
        the orange ball.  As the Robocup playing field became less structured,
        teams have increasingly implemented methods that detect the shape of
        the ball as well.
        \citet{schulz2007ball} used a neural network on
        subsampled luminance images of the ball to detect the ball's shape.
        Recent approaches have focused on detecting the approximately
        circular shape of the ball in typical images. These include
        clustering, hough filters, and RANSAC.


        \todo {
            Indicate the downfalls of simple methods. Methods based on colour
            classification/similarity can suffer from false positives due to
            other objects of similar colours, and can suffer from both false
            positives and false negatives due to unexpected changes in
            lighting. Methods based on circle detection can suffer from false
            positives due to the presence of disks in the environment, or due
            to objects that appear circular when viewed from specific angles.

            Posit the circular appearance of disk-like objects as the worst
            case for current ball-detection methods.
        }

        \todo {
            Note the success of trajectory estimation in helping rule out
            false positives in ball detection for automated annotation of
            sports footage, but indicate that this technique alone is not
            enough to filter out all (non-spherical) false positives (e.g. a
            stationary disk will follow a valid trajectory for a ball).

			Indicate that we would like an algorithm that also works on single images.

            Also note that some methods attempt to gain accuracy by attempting
            only to recognise a specific ball (e.g. the paper that used patch
            descriptors to try and match the pattern on a given soccer ball).
        }

		In 

        \todo {
            Hypothesise that 3D features of a sphere should be enough to
            distinguish them from other round objects.

            (for the common, but important case of spheres resting on a ground
            plane, that are primarily lit from above.)
        }

        To avoid the limitations 

		For simplicity, the scope of the proposed project is limited
        to the common and important case of detecting balls that are resting
        on the ground

        \todo { 
            Hypothesise that spatial relationships between separate 3D features (e.g.
            specular highlight, shadow, shading gradient, the projected ellipse)
            should help to identify spheres, as they have helped in detecting faces.
        }

        \todo {

            Hypothesise that local feature/patch descriptors should be enough
            to identify the specular highlight and shadow cast by a sphere.

        }

        \todo { 
            Contrast the goal of our proposed project with the focus of most other
            algorithms, which generally do not attempt to verify that they have not
            erroneously detected disks.
        }

        As a result of targeting our approach toward the 3D features that
        distinguish spheres from objects such as disks we expect our method
        to be particularly robust to detecting false positives.

	\section{Project plan} {

        \todo {
            Outline the tendency of ball and face detection approaches to use a
            coarse/cheap candidate detection pass and a more accurate/costly
            verification/outlier rejection pass, and propose that we follow the
            same approach and investigate one or two alternatives (Hough
            transform, \citet{Yuan2015} or \citet{Pan2011}, a more ad-hoc
            method?) and compare results - possibly by leveraging the NUbots'
            existing system.
        }

        \todo {
            Propose that we evaluate and compare a number of methods for the
            verification stage (i.e. the stage that differentiates between spheres
            and disks), and list at least two methods for doing so (SVMs, CNNs,
            KNNs, Decision forests, Adaboost?). Indicate that we should
            investigate simple input representations/transformations that might
            help to make these methods more effective (e.g. Fourier transforms,
            wavelets, local binary descriptors, patch descriptors, Haar-like
            features).
        }

        \todo {

                avoid having to purchase images or look into
                copyright/reproduction concerns). Describe how we will obtain
                a collection of spheres, what the collection might contain,
                how we will select environments and lighting conditions, and
                how we will take the photos (include a specification of the
                camera + image quality that will be used).
            }

            }

                Indicate whether images of non spherical objects will appear
                in the dataset, which objects will be selected for inclusion,
                and how the images will be obtained.
            }

            \todo {

            preparation, and final presentation preparation.
