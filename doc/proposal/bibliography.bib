	Abstract = {Abstract The detection of circles from digital images is very important to shape recognition. In this paper, we propose and analyze a novel method, based on power histograms to detect circles in an image. The key idea is to transform an image into several power histograms that are computed from the pairwise distance products referring to the rays emanated from some reference points on the image. According to the circle power theorem, the edge pixels on a circle share the same circle powers with respect to an arbitrary point on the image. The peaks in the power histograms provide strong evidence for the existence of real circles. A multi-reference cross validation among various peaks can systematically remove randomness and eliminate false detections. Experimental results over several synthetic as well as natural images with varying ranges of complexity validate the efficacy of the proposed method in terms of its accuracy, simplicity, and robustness. },

	Abstract = {Accurate and efficient detection of circular objects in images is a challenging computer vision problem. Existing circular object detection methods can be broadly classified into two categories: voting based and maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) based. The former is robust to noise, however its computational complexity and memory requirement are high. On the other hand, MLE based methods (e.g., robust least squares fitting) are more computationally efficient but sensitive to noise, and can not detect multiple circles. This letter proposes Probabilistic Pairwise Voting (PPV), a fast and robust algorithm for circular object detection based on an extension of Hough Transform. The main contributions are threefold. 1) We formulate the problem of circular object detection as finding the intersection of lines in the three dimensional parameter space (i.e., center and radius of the circle). 2) We propose a probabilistic pairwise voting scheme to robustly discover circular objects under occlusion, image noise and moderate shape deformations. 3) We use a mode-finding algorithm to efficiently find multiple circular objects. We demonstrate the benefits of our approach on two real-world problems: 1) detecting circular objects in natural images, and 2) localizing iris in face images.},

@incollection{Fusek2014,
	Abstract = {In this paper, we propose an efficient and interesting way how
	to encode the shape of the objects. A lot of state-of-the art descriptors
	(e.g. HOG, Haar, LBP) are based on the fact that the shape of the objects
	can be described by brightness differences inside the image. It means that
	the descriptors encode the gradient or intensity differences inside the
	image (i.e. edges). In the cases that the edges are very thin, the edge
	information can be difficult to obtain and the dimensionally of feature
	vector (without the method for reduction) is typically large and contains
	redundant information. These ills are motivation for the proposed method
	in that the edges need not be hit directly; the input brightness function
	is transformed using the appropriate image distance function. After this
	transformation, the values of distance function inside objects and
	backgrounds are different and the values can be used for description of
	object appearance. We demonstrate the properties of the method for the
	case of solving the problem of face detection using the classical sliding
	window technique.},

	Abstract = {Recently Viola et al. [2001] have introduced a rapid object detection. scheme based on a boosted cascade of simple feature classifiers. In this paper we introduce a novel set of rotated Haar-like features. These novel features significantly enrich the simple features of Viola et al. and can also be calculated efficiently. With these new rotated features our sample face detector shows off on average a 10% lower false alarm rate at a given hit rate. We also present a novel post optimization procedure for a given boosted cascade improving on average the false alarm rate further by 12.5%.},

@inproceedings{masselli2013haar,
	Abstract = {In this paper, we present a robust method for detecting multiple balls without using color information. The method builds upon the boosted Haar classifier approach introduced by Viola et al. [11] and is applied onto an image from a catadioptric camera without performing rectification of the image. We compare the method with one based on a classical color segmentation approach. Originally both methods have been developed for the participation on the 2012 ``SICK robot day'', an international robotics competition. The task was to collect balls with a robot and put them into dedicated perches within a certain amount of time. Both methods showed to be robust during the competition. Our team placed second out of fifteen contenders.},
